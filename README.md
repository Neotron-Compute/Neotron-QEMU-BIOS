# Neotron QEMU BIOS

A [Neotron](https://github.com/neotron-compute) BIOS that runs on `qemu-system-arm`.

We use QEMU to emulate an Arm Cortex-M3 developer kit - the MPS3-AN547.

Just install `qemu-system-arm` and run:

```console
$ zcat src/disk.img.gz > src/disk.img # Unpack a fresh disk image
$ cargo run

By default, the Neotron OS console is the console where you ran QEMU. The QEMU command line is in [`.cargo/config.toml`](.cargo/config.toml).

To debug, edit the `runner` line in the [`config.toml`](./.cargo/config.toml) (see the comment above it), and then connect with GDB to boot the system:

```console
$ gdb ./target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/neotron-qemu-bios
```

You can also use an ARM Corstone SSE-300 Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP), which emulates a Cortex-M55. This is a free-of-charge download from Arm at https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-ecosystem-fvps. When you run this, the UART console will appear in an `xterm` window (so make sure you have `xterm` installed ... I don't know what it does on Windows).

```console
$ zcat src/disk.img.gz > src/disk.img # Unpack a fresh disk image
$ cargo build
$ ~/FVP_Corstone_SSE-300/models/Linux64_GCC-6.4/FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55 \

## Disk Image

The samples in the disk image are from https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-SDK/tree/a2f224840c4cd5076c767e0df2322b10bde24945.

## Compatibility

This BIOS will run on QEMU when set to emulate an Arm MPS3-AN547 (`-machine mps3-an547`), or on the Arm FVP for that platform. I guess it'll run on the real thing, but they're probably very expensive.

## Features

* Serial output, which goes to and comes from the QEMU console.
