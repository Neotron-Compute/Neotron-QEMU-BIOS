# Neotron QEMU BIOS

A [Neotron](https://github.com/neotron-compute) BIOS that runs on `qemu-system-arm`.

We use QEMU to emulate an Arm Cortex-M3 developer kit - the MPS2-AN385.

Just install `qemu-system-arm` and run:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling neotron-qemu-bios v0.1.0 (/home/user/Neotron-QEMU-BIOS)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.23s
     Running `qemu-system-arm -cpu cortex-m3 -machine mps2-an385 -semihosting-config enable=on,target=native -serial stdio -kernel target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/neotron-qemu-bios`
Neotron QEMU BIOS 0.1.0
Configured Serial console on Serial 0
Welcome to Neotron OS, version 0.3.3 (git:heads/lib-mode-0-g0fda2b0-dirty)!

By default, the Neotron OS console is the console where you ran QEMU. The QEMU command line is in [`.cargo/config.toml`](.cargo/config.toml).

To debug, edit the `runner` line in the config, and then connect with GDB to boot the system:

```console
$ gdb ./target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/neotron-qemu-bios
```
